<h3>How much did I spend yesterday/ last week / last month, and what are they?</h3>
<p>Everything in Spending Journal was designed to help us answer such questions :wink: :wink: :wink:</p> 
<h3>Installation</h3>

<h4>For Development</h4>

<p>We make use of Docker containers to free us from <b>directly installing development dependencies</b> on our machines, as well as to <b>provide a common development environement</b> for all the contributors.</p>

<p>The idea is to mount the source code of each module into a corresponding container.</p>
